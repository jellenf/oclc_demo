    "## Introduction: What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language. More specifically, it is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* High-level: Python is fairly abstracted from actual machine code. You won't have to handle individual bytes for the most part, and Python makes it fairly difficult to access things like memory allocation, as most of that is handled automatically. This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage, but for beginning programmers, it's mostly a relief not to have to think about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* General-purpose: Python can be used to run fully-featured applications and websites, but it can also be used as a scripting language for one-off tasks. You can program games in Python (although it's not great for that) or build machine learning algorithms (it *is* great for that).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreted: Many other languages are constructed such that their code must be \"compiled\" into an application/executable file before it is run. Python code is compiled as it is run, or \"just in time\", by something called an interpreter, allowing for newly-written code to be deployed much more quickly."

    "Python is more human-readable than most other programming languages. Also, you don't typically need to write as much Python code to do a task as you'd have to write in another programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a fairly comprehensive standard library, with well-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is relatively slow to run (compared to C, C++, Rust, C#, Java, etc.), but fast to code in. It also has a larger user base and robust documentation. This is why it's preferred by many as a scripting language for small projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was first published in February, 1991, by Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was initially written in C, although there are now Java and .net implementations.\n",

    "## What is a pandas DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas (from \"panel data\") is a Python library (a collection of modules) that extends Python's basic capabilities by adding support for tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like a spreadsheet, but you don't click in cells and type into it; you use functions to manipulate the data it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though individual cells are more difficult to edit in a DataFrame than in an application like Excel, the platform lends itself well to making sweeping edits quickly. This is a huge advantage when you want to clean data or engineer new features in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has excellent integration with statistical functions, so it's easy to get summary statistics for an entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is used so often by Python programmers that they abbreviate it to `pd` so they don't have to type four extra letters each time they use it.\n"

    "### ** Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "While many other programming languages require the user to declare what kind of type a new object is as it's created, Python's approach is more laissez-faire. Python is coded such that it will attempt to detect what type an object is based on context, usually by checking what methods are associated with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes called \"duck typing\", as in \"if it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it's probably a duck\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful in that objects in Python are a lot more flexible than in some other languages; you can iterate over most of the container objects the same way, and Python will \"know\" what to do with them. The downside is that if a function receives input in a format it's not designed for, there can sometimes be unexpected results."
