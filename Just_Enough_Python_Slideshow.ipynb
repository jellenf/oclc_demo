    "## Introduction: What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language. More specifically, it is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* High-level: Python is fairly abstracted from actual machine code. You won't have to handle individual bytes for the most part, and Python makes it fairly difficult to access things like memory allocation, as most of that is handled automatically. This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage, but for beginning programmers, it's mostly a relief not to have to think about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* General-purpose: Python can be used to run fully-featured applications and websites, but it can also be used as a scripting language for one-off tasks. You can program games in Python (although it's not great for that) or build machine learning algorithms (it *is* great for that).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreted: Many other languages are constructed such that their code must be \"compiled\" into an application/executable file before it is run. Python code is compiled as it is run, or \"just in time\", by something called an interpreter, allowing for newly-written code to be deployed much more quickly."

    "Python has a fairly comprehensive standard library, with well-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is relatively slow to run (compared to C, C++, Rust, C#, Java, etc.), but fast to code in. It also has a larger user base and robust documentation. This is why it's preferred by many as a scripting language for small projects.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Python was initially written in C, although there are now Java and .net implementations.\n",
